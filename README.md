rss is a module created to simplify advanced UI elements on a UI. Inspired by the famous CSS you can create special stylesheet files, one line code styles, and reusable styles.

<hr />

[**Why rss?**](https://imacodr.github.io/rss/)

Using a tool like rss can simplify advanced element styling into one line of code.

```lua
local rss = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.rss)

local frame = Instance.new("Frame")
frame.Parent = script

rss.style({
    padding: {5,4,2,1},
    corner: 5,
})
```

<hr />

**It works with your favorite libraries!**

Optimize Fusion, and Roact with RSS. Adding advanced UI elements just got easier.

```lua
local Fusion = require(path/to/fusion)

local New = Fusion.New

New "Frame" {
    Parent = script,
    [Children] = {
        rss.style({padding: 6}),
        New "TextButton" {
            Text = "Fusion + RSS :D"
        }
    }
}
```
